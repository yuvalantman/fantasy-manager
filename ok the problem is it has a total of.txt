ok the problem is it has a total of almost 190,000 swaps to evaluate, lets suggest some ways to cut that down

the problem we need to solve is this:

I have a team of 10 players 5 front court and 5 back court, each day different teams are playing and a player can be in today's line up if his team is playing, my lineup consists the players that play today but no more than 3 player of the same position and no more than 5 players total, each player also has his salary.
i calculate the daily form by the sum of the forms of my players that are in the lineup for that day when my goal is to maximize the form, which means if I have more than 3 of the same position or more than 5 total playing I will take the best ones, and from the daily form I calculate the weekly form
I'm trying to find the best weekly substitutes to improve my weekly form, I can do 1 or 2 subs only, and I need to make sure that the salary available for swaping players in is the salary of the player I subbed out + the extra salary inserted, and I can only swap players of the same position that means that eventually I can only have 5 of each position, I have around 200 available players so that gets to almost 200,00 swaps that are withing the restrictions of the salary and the position, when I do a swap it can change the whole weekly schedule for the full team because it might change the players that are on the lineup for each specific day, and even if a player has a low form but plays on days where I don't have enough players and can improve my weekly form I cant ignore it, so how can I think of a smart and fast algorithm that would find the best subs
